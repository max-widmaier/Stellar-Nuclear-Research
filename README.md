# Research and Data analysis

## Original Ideation

The goal of this research project is to determine the net energy requirement for fusion reactions to occur.

### System Net Energy Requirement for Fusion (SNER)

SNER is the total amount of energy present in a system in order for fusion to occur.
This includes heat energy, gravitational pressure, kinetic energy, and other forms of energy.

SNER varies slightly from the Coulomb barrier in that it is an amount of energy found through measurements
taken from stellar bodies, therefore, it is closer to the practical energy requirements for fusion to occur.

As an example, the energy required to overcome the Coulomb barrier for the fusion of two deuterium atoms 
is approximately 400 keV, but in practice the energy required is closer to 40 keV. That value of 40 keV is
the SNER for the fusion of two deuterium atoms.

## Research Objective

The objective of this research project is to determine the SNER of stellar cores with varying levels
of gravitational pressure, temperature, atomic mass, and other factors.

From this data, it can be extrapolated how different non-temperature energy forms are required to
ensure that a certain temperature is required for fusion to occur. That is to say, how much
initial energy is required to lower the fusion temperature to a certain level.

## Research Questions

1. What is the SNER of a stellar core?
2. How does gravitational pressure affect the temperature required for fusion to occur?
3. Extrapolate a formula of SNER based on atomic mass.

## Research Hypothesis

If atomic mass remains the same, then SNER will be constant to an inverse proportion of
gravitational pressure, temperature, and other energy forms.

That would mean that higher non-temperature energy forms lower the temperature required for fusion to occur.

## Research Methodology

Research will be conducted in 3 parts:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Analysis
    1. Collect necessary data for calculation of internal core temperature
    2. Using core temperature, calculate gravitational pressure using the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium and the
       ideal gas law
    3. Calculate SNER using the calculated gravitational pressure and core temperature
3. Data Visualization and Extrapolation
    1. Visualize data using graphs with gravitational pressure on the x-axis, atomic mass on the y-axis,
       and temperature as the z-axis
    2. Visualize SNER using graphs with atomic mass on the x-axis and SNER on the y-axis, since it was hypothesized
       should increase/decrease depending on atomic mass.
   3. Extrapolate a formula for SNER based on atomic mass
   4. Extrapolate a formula for SNER based on a proportion of gravitational pressure and temperature
   5. Extrapolate a general formula for SNER based on all factors (atomic mass, gravitational pressure, temperature, etc.)

## Research Resources
1. A Python Environment Capable of Running Jupyter Notebooks
2. An account with the European Space Agency in order to access the Gaia archive (To handle data processing via ADQL)
3. A program to run Jupyter Notebooks, such as:
   1. Jupyter Notebook/Lab via the command line
   2. A compatible IDE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm Professional (This research was conducted using PyCharm Professional under an educational license)

## Data Collection
The first equation we need is the equation for stellar core temperature, which is as follows:

[//]: # (T_c = &#40;\frac{G}{k}&#41;\times&#40;\frac{Mm_a}{R_{avg}}&#41;)

![T_c = &#40;\frac{G}{k}&#41;\times&#40;\frac{Mm_a}{R_{avg}}](imgs/latex_stellar_core_temp_white.png)

Where:

`T sub c` is the stellar core temperature

`G` is the gravitational constant

`k` is the Boltzmann constant

`M` is the mass of the star

`m sub a` is the average atomic mass of the star

`R sub avg` is the average radius of the star

However, a new formula derived from a solution to the Lane-Emden equation is used to calculate the stellar core temperature.
This equation not requiring the average atomic mass of the star, makes it more desirable to the former formula.

The equation is as follows:

![Equation for Temperature](imgs/latex_core_temp.png)

Where:

`T sub c` is the stellar core temperature

`M sub *` is the mass of the star

`R sub *` is the radius of the star

The second equation we need is the equation for gravitational pressure, which is as follows:

[//]: # (P_g = \frac{GM^2}{R^4})

![P_g = \frac{GM^2}{R^4}](imgs/latex_gravitation_pressure_white.png)

Where:

`P sub g` is the gravitational pressure

`G` is the gravitational constant

`M` is the mass of the star

`R` is the radius of the star

### Stellar Radius Collection
Initially, stellar radii were collected from the [VisieR Catalogue of Stellar Diameters dataset](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/II/224)
This dataset contains the radii of 9733 stars.

However, once relating with stellar mass data, there were far too few entries in the resulting dataset to be useful. (Around a few hundred).

An alternative method of collecting stellar radii was needed. Using trigonometry, [LDD (Limb Darkening Distance) data](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/II/346), 
as well as parallax angles to measure distances
provided by the Gaia mission's Data Release 3, stellar radii were calculated using the following equation:

[//]: # (R = \frac{LDD}{\tan\theta})
![R = \frac{LDD}{\tan\theta}](imgs/latex_radius.png)

Where:

`d` is the distance to the star, calculated using the parallax angle:

`Î¸` is the LDD angle in radians, provided by the LDD dataset from VizieR

[//]: # (d = \frac{1000}{p} * 30856775812800)

![d = \frac{1}{\pi}](imgs/latex_distance.png)

Where:

`p` is the parallax angle in milli-arcseconds

**It's very important to note that this data were curated to include
ONLY main-sequence stars for the purposes of temperature calculations** 

### Stellar Mass Collection
Stellar Radii were collected from the [Gaia DR3 Part 6 Dataset on VizieR](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/I/360)
This dataset contains the masses of 218,936,915 non-single stars. 
After collating with the stellar radius dataset (matching based on a cone search), the dataset was reduced to only 
1,643 stars.


### Stellar Temperature Collection

[//]: # (I don't have a dataset for this yet)

### Error Calculation
Errors for radius and temperature were calculated. Formulae and implementations can be seen in `gaia_collation.ipynb`


## Data Analysis


## Data Visualization and Extrapolation
Note to self: I'm probably going to try to extrapolate a formula for SNER using a known energy requirement for fusion
such as D-D fusion (since that is a main part of the Proton-Proton chain).

## Research Results

## Research Conclusion

## Research Limitations

## Research Future Work
### Higher Quality Data
While mathematical methods to determine such data as radii and more importantly temperature exist, they are not necessarily extremely accurate.

They provide a very strong basis for generalization, but the degree of error may provide inaccuracies. Due limited data access, 
such mathematical functions must be taken to forward this research.

### More Data
It is a standard rule in data science that the more data one possesses, the more accurate the resulting model will be.

In tandem with higher quality data, more data will allow for a more accurate model to be created.
